###Project Expectations

Learn how to approach an unfamiliar codebase and create a project from scratch without having any real reference points to guide us. Learn to utilize different APIs and interact with them in unique ways. Clear any knowledge gaps along the way and make something that looks super good.

###Goals and Expectations

Even workload, come to each other with opinions or preferences. Expect equal say in most all decisions made.

###Schedule Expectations

Make sure we're available to work on this until it's done. Turing on the weekends if necessary, otherwise utilize any number of available workspaces

###Communications

Slack, classroom, do your shit.

###Abilities

Fairly even playing field?

###Workload expectations

Just communicate bro and don't be a dick.
