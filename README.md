When I was originally approached to collaborate on World Citizen, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Nick asked me if I wanted to help take this back-end project developed in Ruby on Rails, with which (being a front-end developer) I was completely unfamiliar, and convert it to a front-end, mobile-based application with React. Without any hesitation, I agreed, thinking that, if nothing else, it would be an interesting learning experience and a great challenge. Also, with this being my second time through Mod 2, the instructors allowed me to choose between this and recreating the usual Mod 2 React app, Weathrly, again, and on my own.

Originally, I wasn’t sure how well it would go. I hadn’t really looked at React for about 6 weeks or so, and I wasn’t sure if I had a strong enough understanding of it to be able to carry equal weight on World Citizen, especially taking into account the whole Rails-to-React conversion. It turned out not to be a conversion at all, but an entirely new project, just keeping the same general concepts, a wireframe concept of functionality, and an API key. We got started, and React came back, almost like riding a bicycle, strangely enough. Components, props, state, all of it basically fell into place. Not only did the old concepts come back, but new ones became easier to learn, and I contributed a lot more than I expected, which is always a nice feeling.

Long story short, this has been a great experience, it’s something I’m very happy to have done, and I’m excited to implement new concepts in projects in the future.

Justine approached me a little over 2 months ago asking for some design guidance on her database app, World Citizen. It was a website that would calculate the distance between the user and a socially conscious business, and then reward the user with passport stamps every time they log a purchase at those businesses. After her first pitch of it's purpose, hopes, and goals, I asked to be a collaborator.

Justine took World Citizen to Turing Demo-Night at the WeWork offices a few weeks later, and came in third. It was awesome.

I told Justine later that that day that I wanted to build the front-end of for World Citizen and take it to Demo-night again. I proposed this idea to the mod instructors, they told me to bring on Alex Bruce as my team-member, and the three of us started right away.

A lot of this app came along pretty easily, despite not looking at React for a month. The biggest issue I ran into was learning React Router, and getting mulitple routes to work on a button click - something we don't learn in mod2. The rest of the app came together fairly well, and I kept the design fairly simple throughout. Alex solved a lot of problems before I even looked at them, and met my excitedness with the app on a daily basis. Our code is nice and clean, and will be easy to update as we go on.

I'm really happy with our progress, and can't wait for Demo Night.
